			<p class="information">
				Seahorse is the name given to 54 species of small marine fishes in the genus Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek word hippos meaning 	"horse" and kampos meaning "sea monster".[2] The word "seahorse" is often written as two separate words (sea horse), or hyphenated (sea-horse).[3] 	Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.
